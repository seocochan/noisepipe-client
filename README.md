# [Noisepipe](https://noisepipe.com)

> Noisepipe is an organizer and a player that unifies medias in `YouTube` and `SoundCloud`. 
> It provides extended features like commenting with time stamp, tagging and ordering medias.

I'm a heavy listener(*or sometimes producer*) of musics on web. This project has begun to resolve absence of some features that I need, when collecting medias.
